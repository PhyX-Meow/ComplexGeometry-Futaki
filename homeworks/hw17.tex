\begin{problem}
  Consider the three lines \[
    D_0=\{z^0=0\},D_1=\{z^1=0\},D_2=\{z^2=0\}
  \] in \(\mathbb{P}^2(\mathbb{C})=\{[z^0:z^1:z^2]\}\). We take the family of
  lines passing through \(p_1=D_0\cap D_1\). Blow up \(\mathbb{P}^2\) at \(p_1\)
  to obtain \(\widehat{\mathbb{P}^2}\):
  \begin{center}
    \includestandalone{../figures/17-hw-1-1}
  \end{center}
  Then blow up \(\tilde{D}_1\cap \tilde{D}_2\) to obtain \(\widehat{\widehat
  {\mathbb{P}^2}}\), and finally blow down the \(-1\) curve in the middle:
  \begin{center}
    \includestandalone{../figures/17-hw-1-2}
  \end{center}
  Show that we obtain a family of rational curves with self-intersection 0.
  This gives a vertical \(\mathbb{P}^1\)-bundle.
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}
  Following the same step as in problem 1, but we instead consider the family
  of lines passing through \(D_1\cap D_2\),
  \begin{center}
    \includestandalone{../figures/17-hw-1-3}
  \end{center}
  Show that we obtain a family of rational curves with self-intersection 0.
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}
  Explain that the two families of rational curves with self-intersection 0
  give the product structure \(\mathbb{P}^1\times \mathbb{P}^1\).
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}
  Show that a compact KÃ¤hler manifold with negative Ricci curvature has
  discrete automorphisms. (c.f. lecture notes)
\end{problem}
