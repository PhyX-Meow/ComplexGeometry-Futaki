\begin{problem}
  Let \(\sigma\colon\mathbb{C}^n\to \mathbb{C}^n\) defined by \(\sigma(z)=-z\),
  and consider the group \(G\) generated by \(\sigma\). The origin 0 is a fixed
  point of \(G\) and \(\mathbb{C}^n/G\) has 0 as a singularity.
  \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
  \item Show that for \(n=1\), there is a coordinate change so that \(\mathbb{C}
    /G\) is a smooth manifold and \(\mathbb{C}\to \mathbb{C}/G\) is a smooth
    map.
  \item Let \(\widehat{\mathbb{C}^n}\) be the blow-up at 0, show that the
    \(G\)-action lifts to \(\widehat{\mathbb{C}^n}\), and \(\widehat{\mathbb{C}^n
    }/G\) has a structure of non-singular complex manifold such that 
    \(\widehat{\mathbb{C}^n}\to \widehat{\mathbb{C}^n}/G\) is smooth.
  \end{enumerate}
