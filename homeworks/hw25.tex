\begin{problem}
  Let \(\Gamma\) be a subgroup of \(\mathbb{C}^2\) generated by \(\gamma_1,\gamma_2,
  \gamma_3,\gamma_4\) which are linearly independent over \(\mathbb{R}\). Consider
  the complex torus \(T=\mathbb{C}^2/\Gamma\) and its automorphism
  \(\sigma\colon T\to T\), \(\sigma(z)=-z\).
  \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
  \item Show that \(\sigma\) has 16 fixed points.
  \item Let \(\tilde{T}\) be the blow-up of \(T\) at the 16 fixed points. Show that
    \(\tilde{T}/\left<\sigma\right> \) has a structure of non-singular complex
    manifold such that \(\pi\colon\tilde{T}\to \tilde{T}/\left<\sigma\right> \) is
    holomorphic.
  \item Show that, with respect to the holomorphic structure of
    \(\tilde{T}/\left<\sigma\right> \), the canonical bundle is trivial and
    \(h^{1,0}=0\). (Thus \(\tilde{T}/\left<\sigma\right> \) is a K3-surface, called
    the Kummer surface).
