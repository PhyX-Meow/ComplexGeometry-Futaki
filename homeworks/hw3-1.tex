\begin{example*}
  Let \[
    H=\{[0:z^1:\cdots :z^m]\in \mathbb{P}^m(\mathbb{C}):(z^1,\ldots,z^m)\neq 0\}
  \] be the hyperplane in \(\mathbb{P}^m(\mathbb{C})\). The associated line bundle
  \([H]\) is called the hyperplane bundle, denoted by \(\mathcal{O}(1)\). And
  \(L_{-H}\) is denoted by \(\mathcal{O}(-1)\).
\end{example*}

\begin{problem}
  Show that \(\mathcal{O}(-1)\) is isomorphic to \(L\) in homework 2.
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}
  By problem 1, \(\mathcal{O}(-1)=L\to \mathbb{P}^m(\mathbb{C})\) is a holomorphic
  line bundle. Its zero section, \ie\ the subset of \(L\) consisting of zero vectors
  in each fiber, is a submanifold of \(L\) isomorphic (bi-holomorphic) to
  \(\mathbb{P}^m(\mathbb{C})\). Show that \[
    L\setminus\text{zero section}\underset{\text{bi-holomorphic}}{\cong}
    \mathbb{C}^{m+1}\setminus\{0\}
  .\] 
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}
  Let \(n=m+1\) in problem 2, so we have \(\mathcal{O}(-1)=L\to \mathbb{P}^{n-1}
  (\mathbb{C})\). Let \(U\) be a neighborhood of the zero section in \(L\), and
  \(V\) be a neighborhood of \(0\) in \(\mathbb{C}^n\). By problem 2, we may take
  \(U\) and \(V\) so that \[
    U\setminus\text{zero section}\cong V\setminus\{0\}
  .\] Now let \(M\) be a complex manifold of \(\dim n\), and take \(p\in M\). Take
  a neighborhood \(V\) of \(p\) such that \[
    V\setminus\{p\}\cong U\setminus\text{zero section in }L.
  \] Modify \(M\) be first removing \(V\) and then inserting \(U\) in the place
  of \(V\).

  Show that the resulting space \(\hat{M}\) is a complex manifold of dimension \(n\).
\end{problem}
\begin{definition*}
  \(\hat{M}\) is called the \textbf{blow-up} (or \textbf{monoidal transformation}) of
  \(M\) at \(p\).
\end{definition*}
