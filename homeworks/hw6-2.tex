\begin{problem}
  Starting from a presheaf \(\{S(U)\}_{U\in \mathcal{U}}\), we have the sheaf \(S\)
  as described in the notes. From this sheaf \(S\) we can construct another presheaf
  \(\Gamma(U,S)\). In general \(S(U)\) and \(\Gamma(U,S)\) do not coincide. In
  \emph{Frank Wazner}'s book \emph{Foundations of differentiable manifolds and Lie
  groups}, page 168, Proposition 5.8, sufficient conditions for \(S(U)\) and 
  \(\Gamma(U,S)\) to coincide are described. Report on this. (There would be other
  textbooks).

\begin{problem}
  Let \(M\) be a Riemann surface, (complex manifold of complex dim 1). Let \(D=\{p\}\)
  be a divisor consisting of one point. What is the quotient sheaf \[
    \mathcal{O}_M/\mathcal{O}_D
  ?\] (This is the typical one called the skyscraper sheaf).
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}
  Prove the homotopy formula \[
    \mu_{\mathcal{V}}^{\mathcal{U}}-\lambda_{\mathcal{V}}^{\mathcal{U}}=\delta\circ 
    \mathcal{h}+\mathcal{h}\circ \delta
  \] in the proof of lemma.

  (If you are stuck, you may refer to \emph{Morrow-Kodaira}, page 32, or any other
  textbooks on algebraic topology).
