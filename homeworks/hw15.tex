\begin{problem}
  Show that the first Betti number \(b_1\) is even on a compact K\"ahler manifold
  \(M\).
\end{problem}
\begin{remark}
  \emph{Yoichi Miyaoka} porved the converse in complex dimension 2: If the Betti 
  number of a compact complex surface \(M\) is even, then \(M\) is K\"ahler (\ie\ 
  \(M\) admits a K\"ahler metric). \emph{Y.T.Siu (箫荫堂)} later gave a differen
  proof and the result is now known as Miyaoka-Siu theorem.
