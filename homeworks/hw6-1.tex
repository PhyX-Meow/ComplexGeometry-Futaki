\begin{problem}
  Show that a stalk \(S_x\) of a sheaf \(S\) has discrete topology with respect to
  the relative topology.
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}
  Show that \(\sigma(U)\) is an open set in \(S\) when \(\sigma\) is a section on
  \(U\). Hence \((S,\pi,X)\) is a sheaf and \(U\) is an open set in \(X\).
